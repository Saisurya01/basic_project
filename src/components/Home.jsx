    <p>I’m a Computer Science Honours student with a strong base in Java, data structures and algorithms, and web technologies like HTML and CSS. I enjoy problem-solving and building simple, clean user experiences.

Over the past year I’ve been strengthening my fundamentals in Java and DSA while exploring how the web works at a deeper level. I’m now focused on expanding my frontend skills with modern tools and JavaScript so I can build interactive websites and improve my ability to solve real development challenges.

My goal is to apply my skills in an internship or a junior developer role where I can work with experienced engineers, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow into a well-rounded developer.

If you’re working on web development, Java-based applications, or have opportunities for learners, I’d be glad to connect</p>
